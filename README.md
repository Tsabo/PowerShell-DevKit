## 🎯 The Problem

**Tired of manually syncing your development environment across multiple machines?**

We've all been there - following lengthy OneNote instructions, manually installing tools, copy-pasting configurations, and hoping you didn't miss anything. Every new machine or reinstall meant hours of tedious setup work.

**PowerShell DevKit eliminates that pain:**

- ✅ **One command** to set up your complete environment
- ✅ **Git-based configuration** keeps everything in sync
- ✅ **Automatic updates** across all your machines
- ✅ **Intelligent recovery** when things go wrong
- ✅ **Consistent experience** whether you're on your desktop, laptop, or fresh Windows install

Clone once, run `Setup.ps1`, and you're done. Your perfect PowerShell environment, reproduced identically everywhere.

### 🔄 Updating PowerShell-DevKit

To update to the latest version with new features and improvements:

```powershell
